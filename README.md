# Set Builder UI

A tiny, framework-free web application that lets you build a mathematical set
from user input. Add values one at a time or in bulk, see them rendered as
removable chips, and copy the resulting set literal to your clipboard.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser. That's it. All styling and behavior is in the
companion `styles.css` and `app.js` files.

## Features

- Prevents duplicate values automatically using the `Set` data structure.
- Supports bulk entry via comma or newline separated values.
- Provides accessible feedback for actions such as add, remove, clear, and copy.
- Generates a formatted set literal that can be copied to the clipboard.
